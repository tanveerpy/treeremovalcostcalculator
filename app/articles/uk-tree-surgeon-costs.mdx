# UK Tree Surgeon Costs: What to Expect in 2025

*Published on: February 5, 2026 | Author: UK Operations Lead*

In the United Kingdom, tree removal (or "tree surgery") is a highly regulated and technical profession. Between the dense urban layouts and strict environmental laws like Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs), the cost of removing a tree in the UK can differ significantly from other countries.

## 1. Average Cost breakdown (2025)
A typical UK tree surgeon charges between **£150 and £500 per day per person**. Most jobs require at least two people (a climber and a ground worker).
- **Small Tree (&lt;5m):** £150 - £400
- **Medium Tree (5-10m):** £400 - £1,200
- **Large Tree (10-15m):** £1,200 - £3,000+

## 2. Tree Preservation Orders (TPO) and Conservation Areas
Before you even get a quote, you must check if your tree is protected.
- **TPO:** A specific order protecting a single tree or group. Removing one without permission can result in fines up to **£20,000**.
- **Conservation Areas:** All trees over a certain size (7.5cm diameter) require 6 weeks' notice to the local council before work begins.

Professional tree surgeons often handle these applications for you, but they may charge an administrative fee of £50-£100.

## 3. Location Factors: The London Premium
If you are in London or the South East, expect to pay **20-30% more** than the national average. This is due to:
- Higher disposal fees at tipping sites.
- Parking and congestion charges for heavy machinery.
- Limited access in small terraced gardens.

## 4. Waste Disposal and "Chipping"
UK waste laws are strict. You cannot simply dump tree waste. 
- **Green Waste Removal:** Most surgeons include chipping and hauling in their quote.
- **Keeping the Wood:** If you want to keep the wood for a fire, you might save £50-£100 on disposal fees, but the surgeon will still charge for the time taken to "log it up."

## 5. Stump Grinding in Britain
UK soil can be rocky or clay-heavy, affecting stump grinding.
- **Standard Stump:** £80 - £250.
- **Deep Grinding:** Required if you plan to build over the area.
