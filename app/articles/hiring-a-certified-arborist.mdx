# Hiring a Certified Arborist: Interview Questions and Checklists

*Published on: February 5, 2026 | Author: Arboriculture Quality Rater*

Anyone with a truck and a chainsaw can call themselves a "tree expert," but the difference between a professional arborist and a "hacker" is significant. Hiring the wrong person can lead to property damage, killed trees, and massive legal liability for you. Here is how to find and hire a true professional.

## 1. Look for the ISA Certification
The **International Society of Arboriculture (ISA)** is the gold standard for tree care professionals. An ISA Certified Arborist has:
- At least three years of full-time work experience.
- Passed a comprehensive exam covering biology, safety, and equipment.
- Committed to a code of ethics.

In the UK, look for **Arboricultural Association Approved Contractors** and **NPTC** qualifications for specific tasks.

## 2. The Insurance "Must-Haves"
Never take their word for it. Request a Certificate of Insurance (COI) sent directly from their agent to you. 
- **Liability Insurance:** Protects your house and property.
- **Workers' Compensation:** This is critical. If a worker is injured on your property and the company doesn't have Workers' Comp, **YOU** could be liable for their medical bills.

## 3. 5 Essential Questions to Ask
1. **"Can you provide a written, itemized estimate?"** Never accept a verbal quote.
2. **"What is your standard for pruning?"** If they say "topping" or "lion-tailing," do not hire them. These practices weaken and eventually kill trees.
3. **"What equipment will you use to access the tree?"** This helps you understand if they will be driving heavy trucks over your lawn or septic tank.
4. **"How will you handle clean-up and disposal?"** Ensure the quote includes stump grinding and debris removal if that's what you want.
5. **"Do you have local references?"** Check reviews on Google, Angi, or Checkatrade carefully.

## 4. Beware of Red Flags
- **Door-to-Door Solicitation:** Reputable arborists are usually too busy to knock on doors looking for work, especially after a storm.
- **Pay Upfront:** Never pay more than a small deposit before the work is completed and you are satisfied.
- **The "Low-Ball" Quote:** If one quote is 50% lower than the others, they are likely skipping insurance costs or proper safety protocols.
