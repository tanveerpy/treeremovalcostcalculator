# Understanding Tree Removal Permits in the USA

*Published on: February 5, 2026 | Author: Legal & Regulatory Affairs*

Can you legally cut down a tree on your own property? In the United States, the answer is often "it depends." While you own the land, many municipalities, counties, and Homeowners Associations (HOAs) have strict rules regarding the removal of significant vegetation. 

## 1. Why Do You Need a Permit?
Permit requirements are usually driven by:
- **Environmental Protection:** Preventing erosion, maintaining local micro-climates, and protecting wildlife habitats.
- **Historic Preservation:** Protecting "Heritage Trees" that are over a certain age.
- **Community Aesthetics:** Maintaining the tree canopy of a neighborhood.

## 2. Common Triggers for a Permit
Most cities use a "Diameter at Breast Height" (DBH) measurement as the cutoff. 
- **Example (Austin, TX):** Any tree of a specific species (like Oak) over 19 inches DBH is considered protected.
- **Example (Portland, OR):** Permits are required for most trees over 12 inches DBH.

Species also matter. "Invasive" species might be removable without a permit, while "Native" species are highly protected.

## 3. The Application Process
1. **Arborist Report:** Many cities require a certified arborist (ISA) to sign off that the tree is dead, diseased, or hazardous.
2. **Site Plan:** A drawing showing where the tree is in relation to your house and property lines.
3. **Application Fee:** Usually ranges from $50 to $200.
4. **Replacement Requirement:** Some cities require you to plant one or more new trees for every protected tree you remove.

## 4. Homeowners Associations (HOAs)
Even if your city doesn't require a permit, your HOA might. Removing a tree without HOA approval can lead to significant fines and legal action to replace the tree at your expense.

## 5. Exceptions: When You Don't Need a Permit
- **Imminent Danger:** If a storm has split a tree and it's leaning over your house, most cities allow for "Emergency Removal" without prior approval, though you should take photos as evidence.
- **Small Trees:** Generally, anything under 6-10 inches DBH is exempt.
