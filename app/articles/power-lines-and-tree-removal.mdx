# Power Lines and Tree Removal: Safety Protocols and Legalities

*Published on: February 5, 2026 | Author: Utility & Safety Compliance Officer*

Trees and power lines are a dangerous combination. When roots or branches interfere with electrical infrastructure, the risks include widespread power outages, fires, and lethal electrocution. If you have a tree touching or near a power line, you need to understand the complex legal and safety protocols involved.

## 1. The 10-Foot Rule
In most jurisdictions, any tree work within **10 feet (3 meters)** of a high-voltage power line requires a specialized certification known as "Utility Line Clearance." Standard tree surgeons are not legally allowed to work within this zone due to the risk of "arcing," where electricity jumps from the line to a tool or person without direct contact.

## 2. Who is Responsible for the Cost?
- **Main Distribution Lines:** If a tree on your property is threatening a main line (the ones that serve multiple houses), the utility company will often prune or remove the parts of the tree for free to protect their grid. However, they usually only perform "clearance," not an aesthetic trim.
- **Service Drop Lines:** This is the line that runs from the pole to your specific house. In many cases, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the trees around this line. Check with your local utility provider (e.g., PG&E in the US, National Grid in the UK, or Hydro One in Canada).

## 3. The Danger of "Hot" Wood
Trees are composed of water and minerals, making them excellent conductors of electricity. If a branch is touching a wire and you touch the base of the tree, you can be killed. Even if the branch isn't touching, a "step potential" can be created in the ground during a fault, where electricity flows through the soil.

## 4. How Professionals Handle the Job
1. **The Spotter:** A dedicated ground worker who does nothing but watch the lines and the climber to ensure the 10-foot clearance is maintained.
2. **Insulated Tools:** Use of non-conductive fiberglass poles and specialized equipment.
3. **Power Taps:** In extreme cases, the utility company may need to temporarily disconnect power to the street so the tree surgeon can work safely.

## 5. Liability and Lawsuits
If your tree falls and takes out a neighborhood power line because you neglected its maintenance, you could be held liable for the repair costs (which can reach tens of thousands of dollars) and any damages caused by the outage.
