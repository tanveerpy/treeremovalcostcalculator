# Fallen Tree Removal: Emergency Services and Insurance Claims

*Published on: February 5, 2026 | Author: Insurance Claims Consultant*

When a tree falls during a storm, the situation is chaotic. Your first instinct is to get it out of the way, but your second thought is usually "will my insurance pay for this?" The answer depends on where the tree landed and why it fell.

## 1. The "Where it Landed" Rule
Homeowners insurance generally only covers tree removal if the tree has hit a **covered structure** (like your house, garage, or fence).
- **Hits the House:** Insurance usually pays for the cost to remove the tree from the roof and most of the disposal.
- **Hits the Lawn:** If the tree falls safely in the middle of your yard and hits nothing, most insurance policies will **not** pay for its removal. You are responsible for the cleanup cost.

## 2. The "Acts of God" vs. Negligence
Insurance companies look for "proximate cause."
- **Healthy Tree / Major Storm:** Usually covered (Act of God).
- **Dead/Diseased Tree:** If the insurance investigator determines that the tree was dead and you neglected to remove it, they may deny the claim based on "maintenance negligence."

## 3. My Tree, Neighbor's House (Liability)
If your tree falls onto your neighbor’s house, **their** insurance usually pays for the damage. In the insurance world, "where it lands determines the claim." However, if they can prove you knew the tree was dead and did nothing, their insurance company may "subrogate" (sue) your insurance company to recover the costs.

## 4. What to Do Immediately After a Fall
1. **Safety First:** Stay away from the tree; it may be entangled with power lines or under tension.
2. **Photography:** Take detailed photos of the damage from multiple angles before anything is moved.
3. **Mitigate Damage:** Cover any holes in your roof with a tarp to prevent water damage, but let pros handle the tree itself.
4. **Call the Pros:** Get an "Emergency Removal" quote. Professional services will often bill the insurance company directly if there is structural damage.

## 5. Deductibles and Limits
Most policies have a limit on tree removal (often $500–$1,000 per tree). If the removal costs $3,000 and your limit is $1,000, you will have to pay the remaining $2,000 out of pocket.
