# How to Identify a Hazardous Tree: Signs of Rot and Disease

*Published on: February 5, 2026 | Author: Senior Diagnostic Arborist*

Not every sick tree needs to be removed, but every hazardous tree is a ticking time bomb. Identifying structural failure before it happens can save your home and potentially lives. Here are the professional signs that a tree has become a high-risk liability.

## 1. The Crown: Dieback and Deadwood
Look up. The top of the tree (the crown) is the best indicator of overall health.
- **V-Shaped Dieback:** If leaves are only growing on lower branches and the top is bare, the tree's vascular system is failing.
- **Clutching:** Large dead branches hanging in the canopy (widowmakers) are immediate hazards that must be removed.

## 2. The Trunk: Cavities and Fungi
The trunk is the tree's structural spine. 
- **Conks and Mushrooms:** If you see shelf-like fungi growing out of the trunk, it's a sign of internal decay/rot. The "body" of the fungus is eating the tree from the inside out.
- **Deep Cavities:** Holes in the trunk can be homes for wildlife, but if they exceed 30% of the trunk's diameter, the structural integrity is compromised.
- **Missing Bark:** Large patches of bark falling off (cankers) indicate localized dead zones.

## 3. The Base: Root Heave and Soil Cracks
The roots are the anchor. If they fail, the whole tree goes.
- **Soil Mounding:** If the soil is lifting on one side of the tree, it’s a sign the root plate is failing and the tree is starting to tip.
- **Fresh Cracks:** New cracks in the ground around the base of the tree after a storm indicate active movement.

## 4. The Lean: Sudden vs. Gradual
A tree that has grown with a lean over 20 years is usually structurally sound (it grew reactive wood to compensate). However, a tree that **suddenly** starts to lean is an emergency. 
- **Identify the Hinge:** Look for the soil on the opposite side of the lean. Is it cracking? If so, the tree is falling now.

## 5. Co-Dominant Stems and "Included Bark"
When a tree has two main trunks growing in a 'V' shape, it creates a weak point. If you see a crack where the two trunks meet, or if there is "included bark" (bark compressed between the two stems), they are likely to split during high winds.

### Danger Level Matrix
| Symptom | Risk Level | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mushroom on Trunk | High | Professional Inspection |
| Dead branches < 2" | Low | Standard Pruning |
| Sudden Lean > 10° | Extreme | Immediate Removal |
| Large V-Split in Trunk | High | Bracing or Removal |

**Final Word:** If you are unsure, never climb the tree to investigate. A certified arborist can use ultrasonic tools (Tomography) to see inside the trunk without cutting it, giving you a definitive answer on safety.
